 Algo for calculating complexity should be based on 3 parameters:
 1. Color of objects (red, blue, green, white, black, yellow): score of 1
 Note: Color of objects is not used as a parameter for the MVP
 3. Shape of objects
 - Circle, Rectangle, Square, Triangle - pool 1
 - Cube, Cylinder, Sphere, Cuboid - pool 2
 - Cone, Pyramid, Torus, Prism - pool 3
 4. Number of objects in scene (init in Main VC: sceneComplexity)
 Approach to calculate sceneComplexity: Calculate number of optimum tiles which can be fit onto
 a detected plane. Choose a random number of tiles out of total tiles and throw in those many
 number of shapes onto those particular tiles. Let's say total number of tiles we have across all
 PlaneAnchorNodes is 25, we choose a number 16 (which is the complexity - since more
 number of objects increases confusion), we choose 16 random tiles to place these
 objects. As we go along we increase this complexity.
 
 Complexity is deemed to be higher for objects from pools higher in hierarachy (pool3 >> pool1).
 Hence, probability array, such as [0.8, 0.2, 0.0] will be used to determine the object which is
 generated when the associated function is called from main VC. Here, when associated function is
 called from main VC, object generated has 80% chance it came from pool1, and 20% chance it came
 from pool3
