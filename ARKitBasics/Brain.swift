 Algo for calculating complexity should be based on 4 parameters:
 1. Number of objects (ranges from 1 to 5): respective score
 2. Color of objects (red, blue, green, white, black, yellow): score of 1
    - possibly we can include half colors later whose score can be 2
 3. Shape of objects:
    - Circle, Rectangle, Square: score of 1
    - Cube, Cylinder, Sphere: score of 2
    - Cone, Pyramid, Torus, Cuboid: score of 3
 4. Number of objects in scene:
    This is more difficult to calculate.
    Approach: Calculate number of optimum tiles which can be fit onto a detected plane.
    Choose a random number of tiles out of total tiles and throw in those many number of
    shapes onto those particular tiles. Let's say total number of tiles we have across all
    PlaneAnchorNodes is 25, we choose a number 16 (which is the complexity - since more
    number of objects increases confusion), we choose 16 random tiles to place these
    objects. As we go along we increase this complexity.
